🧮 Arbitrary Precision Calculator
📌 Overview

This project implements an arbitrary precision calculator using linked lists to perform arithmetic operations on numbers of unlimited size, overcoming the limitations of built-in data types.

✨ Features

🔢 Supports large integers beyond standard data type limits

🔗 Uses linked lists for dynamic digit storage

➕➖✖️ Implements addition, subtraction, and multiplication

🧠 Efficient memory and carry handling

🔄 How It Works

Each digit of a number is stored in a node of a linked list. Arithmetic operations are performed digit by digit, similar to manual calculations, ensuring accuracy for very large numbers.
